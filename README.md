## Installation

### With poetry

For an [introduction to poetry](https://dev.to/yukinagae/beginner-guide-on-poetry-new-python-dependency-management-tool-4327/).

```
$ poetry add geojsplit
```

will add geojsplit to your current virtual environment and update your poetry.lock file. If you would like to contribute or develop geojsplit

```
$ git clone https://github.com/underchemist/geojsplit.git
$ cd geojsplit
$ poetry install
```

You may need some extra configuration to make poetry play nice with conda virtual environments

```
poetry config settings.virtualenvs.path <path_to_conda_install>/envs  # tell poetry where you virtualenvs are stored
poetry config settings.virtualenvs.create 0  # tell poetry not to try to create its own virtualenvs.
```

See https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/issues/105#issuecomment-498042062 for more info.

```
$ poetry config settings.virtualenvs.path $CONDA_ENV_PATH
$ poetry config settings.virtualenvs.create 0
```

### With pip
Though geojsplit is developed using [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/) (and as such does not have a setup.py), [pep517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) implementation in pip means we can install it directly

```
$ pip install geojsplit
```

## Usage

Although both the library code and the command line tool of geojsplit are relatively simple, there are use cases for both. You may want to use the backend `GeoJSONBatchStreamer` class directly in order to do more sophisticated manipulations with GeoJOSN documents. As a command line tool geojsplit also works well as a preprocessing step for working with large GeoJSON documents i.e. for piping into GDALâ€™s ogr2ogr tool.

### As a library

Once installed, geojsplit can be imported in like

```
from geojsplit import geojsplit

geojson = geojsplit.GeoJSONBatchStreamer("/path/to/some.geojson")

for feature_collection in geojson.stream():
    do_something(feature_collection)
    ...
```

If the `/path/to/some.geojson` does not exists, `FileNotFound` will be raised.

You can control how many features are streamed into a Feature Collection using the batch parameter (Default is 100).

```
>>> g = geojson.stream(batch=2)  # instatiate generator object
>>> data = next(g)
>>> print(data)
{"features": [{"geometry": {"coordinates": [[[-118.254638, 33.7843], [-118.254637,
33.784231], [-118.254556, 33.784232], [-118.254559, 33.784339], [-118.254669,
33.784338], [-118.254668, 33.7843], [-118.254638, 33.7843]]], "type": "Polygon"},
"properties": {}, "type": "Feature"}, {"geometry": {"coordinates": [[[-118.254414,
33.784255], [-118.254232, 33.784255], [-118.254232, 33.784355], [-118.254414,
33.784355], [-118.254414, 33.784255]]], "type": "Polygon"}, "properties": {}, "type":
"Feature"}], "type": "FeatureCollection"}
>>> print(len(data["features"]))
2
```

If your GeoJSON document has a different format or you want to iterate over different elements on your document, you can also pass a different value to the `prefix` keyword argument (Default is `'features.item'`). This is an argument passed directly down to a `ijson.items` call, for more information see https://github.com/ICRAR/ijson.

### As a command line tool

After installing you should have the geojsplit executable in your `PATH`.

```
$ geojsplit -h
usage: geojsplit [-h] [-l GEOMETRY_COUNT] [-a SUFFIX_LENGTH] [-o OUTPUT]
                [-n LIMIT] [-v] [-d] [--version]
                geojson

Split a geojson file into many geojson files.

positional arguments:
geojson               filename of geojson file to split

optional arguments:
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
-l GEOMETRY_COUNT, --geometry-count GEOMETRY_COUNT
                        the number of features to be distributed to each file.
-a SUFFIX_LENGTH, --suffix-length SUFFIX_LENGTH
                        number of characters in the suffix length for split
                        geojsons
-o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output directory to save split geojsons
-n LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        limit number of split geojson file to at most LIMIT,
                        with GEOMETRY_COUNT number of features.
-v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
-d, --dry-run         see output without actually writing to file
--version             show geojsplit version number
```

By default splitted GeoJSON files are saved as `filename_x<SUFFIX_LENGTH characters long>.geojson`. Default SUFFIX_LENGTH is 4, meaning that 456976 unique files can be generated. If you need more use `-a` or `--suffix-length` to increase this value appropriately.

The `--geometry-count` flag corresponds to the batch keyword argument for `GeoJSONBatchStreamer.stream` method. Note that if GEOMETRY_COUNT does not divide equally into the number of features in the Feature Collection, the last batch of features will be < GEOMETRY_COUNT.

Finally, to only iterate over the the first n elements of a GeoJSON document, use `--limit`.
